Difference between window and document object:

Document object VS window object

Window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
i.e., if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.

An iframe actually is considered as a new window with its own document loaded into it.
The original, parent window, is responsible for other windows to be loaded, not the document.
The property to access a frame is window.frames[], which is an array of all the frames. If you only have one iframe you access it by using window.frames[0]. 
Since the iframe is also a window object, accessing window properties of that frame is done by using window.frames[0].mywindowproperty.

The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object. In the below example, title is the property of document object.
The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. 
In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.
